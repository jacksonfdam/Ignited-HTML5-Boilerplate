I used this setup for a while, so I thought I shoild share this with everyone.
This setup is based on latest CodeIgniter and is a good starting point for almost any CI project (or even if you just want to work on markup)!

Contents:
 *   Fresh flamy CodeIgniter 2.0.2
 *   Application and systems folders renamed â€“ makes more sense
 *   Some extra stuff for CI like autoloading models etc. See config.php
 *   Language detection script based on browser headers. See config.php
 *   Errors output with brand new printr() function. See index.php
 *   Windows 7 user agent detection fixed
 *   Error 404 page already backed in and working. See controllers folder
 *   Several helpful helpers with mail helper that actually works. See helpers folder
 *   Templating library to spice it up.
 *   Minify script that works like a charm with cachebusting. Mod rewrite to finish it off.
 *   Best of latest HTML5 Boilerplate.
 *   Best CSS reset, base for your styles, normalize.css and snippets collection. Load whatever you want.
 *   Solid base for almost any JS heavy app (jQuery, jQuery UI, Selectivizr and even jQuery Animations Enhanced are included)

So what are you waiting for? "git clone git@github.com:suprMax/Ignited-HTML5-Boilerplate.git"!
