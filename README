I used this setup for a while, so I thought I shoild share this with everyone.
This setup is based on latest CodeIgniter and is a good starting point for almost any CI project (or even if you just want to work on markup)!

Contents:

  * Fresh flamy CodeIgniter 2.0.2
  * Best of latest HTML5 Boilerplate.
  * Templating library to spice it up.
  * Minify script that works like a charm with cachebusting
  * Some extra stuff for CI like autoloading models etc. See config.php
