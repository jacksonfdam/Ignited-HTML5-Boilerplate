I used this setup for a while, so I thought I shoild share this with everyone.
This setup is based on latest CodeIgniter and is a good starting point for almost any CI project (or even if you just want to work on markup)!

Contents:
  * Fresh flamy CodeIgniter 2.0.2
  * Application and systems folders renamed - makes more sense  
  * Templating library to spice it up.
  * Minify script that works like a charm with cachebusting
  * Some extra stuff for CI like autoloading models etc. See config.php
  * Errors output with brand new printr() function. See index.php  
  * Best of latest HTML5 Boilerplate.
  * Best CSS reset, base for your styles, normalize.css and snippets collection
  * Solid base for almost any JS heavy app (jQuery, jQuery UI, Selectivizr and even jQuery Animations Enhanced are included)

So what are you waiting for? "git clone git@github.com:suprMax/Ignited-HTML5-Boilerplate.git"!
